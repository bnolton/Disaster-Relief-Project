# Disaster-Relief-Project

Here is the Disaster Relief project I completed in a group during the Statistical Modelling class at UVA during the Spring 2025 semester. The holdout data is in 2 zipped folders because of the size of the files. Part 1 is just a halfway marker through the project, Part 2 is the full project. The deliverable for Part 1 was a writeup, whereas the deliverable for Part 2 was a presentation. The presentation slides are available here but not hte video of the presenatation (sorry). Please enjoy!

This project was to analyize photos taken during after the earthquake in Haiti in 2010. Humanitarian aid workers struggled to know where to find people displaced by the earthquake. It became known that these individuals where using blue tarps as temporary shelters. As a result pilots would fly over areas taking pictures in hopes of finding blue tarps to identify people in need. Our task was to analyze the photos to determine whether these photos contained blue tarps or not. We used a variety of machine learning methods such as Logistic Regression, LDA, QDA, KNN, Penalized Logistic Regression, random forest and boosting, and Support Vector Machines.
